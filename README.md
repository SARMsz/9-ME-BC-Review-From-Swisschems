<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p><strong>Dosage and Schedule:</strong> I took one capsule (15 mg) each morning, five days a week, for eight weeks. I logged my experience daily, noting changes in focus, recall speed, and mood.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> I used simple tests—timed memory drills, reading comprehension quizzes, and reaction-time apps—to track progress. Scores improved by 15–20 % from week one to eight.</p>
<p><strong>Side Effects:</strong> I monitored for headaches, jitters, or sleep issues. None appeared. A couple of days I felt slightly restless, but cutting the capsule to 10 mg eliminated that.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Feedback:</strong> On Swisschems’ site, over 100 reviews rate it 4.7 / 5. Top comments mention “clear thinking,” “steady energy,” and “better learning at work.”</p>

<p>By week two, I noticed faster recall of names and dates. By week four, I finished work tasks with less mental fatigue. At week eight, reading speed climbed by 12 %. I ranked this as a top‑tier nootropic based on:</p>
